I work for a [consultancy](https://6point6.co.uk/) which has a large number of public sector clients. Recently one of the directors said this key but brief Slack message 

> Data Quality is critical to all businesses and more so in public sector as Architects, Engineers and Consultants we should be at the forefront of the drive to improve DQ in everything we do.

He was saying this as the UK government has recently published the [Government Data Quality Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework#Anticipate-changes-affecting-data-quality). This got me motivated to dig around and see what other guidance is currently provided by the government in regards to all things data. A very quick search came up with the following 5 bits of information.

## 1. [The Government Data Quality Framework](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-government-data-quality-framework/the-government-data-quality-framework#Anticipate-changes-affecting-data-quality)

An informative piece of guidance around a new framework for data quality management within Government, designed by the [Government Data Quality Hub](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-data-quality-hub). It dives into why government should have a data quality framework, expressing that data is often of unknown or questionable quality which can lead to poorly informed decisions.

It is split into two parts:
1. Data quality principles, data lifecycle and data quality dimensions
2. Data quality action plans, root cause analysis, metadata guidance, communicating quality guidance and data maturity models.

### Data Quality principles

- **Commit to data quality** - Create a sense of accountability, embed data management and governance, create a data quality capability.
- **Know your users and their needs** - Ensure data is fit for purpose by getting user needs and determining data quality requirements
- **Assess quality throughout the data lifecycle** - Adopt appropriate data quality tests and assessments throughout each stage of the data lifecycle, the earlier bad data is found the easier it is to fix.
- **Communicate data quality clearly and effectively** - Provide coherent data quality information and explain it's impact, create standards and communicate them to all stakeholders involved. Generate data documentation and metadata  
- **Anticipate changes affecting data quality** - Through communication, change management, perform analysis on system changes which may impact data quality and determine how that impacts downstream data users.
